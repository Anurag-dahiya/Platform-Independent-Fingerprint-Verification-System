# Platform-Independent-Fingerprint-Verification-System
The below described is a Platform Independent Fingerprint Verification  System , which either accepts or rejects the user‟s identity by matching  against an existing fingerprint database. It is based on the identification and  comparison of local features of ridges. 
 # Working 
 Fingerprint is a unique pattern of ridges and valleys on the  surface of finger of an individual. A ridge is defined as a single  curved segment and a valley is the region between two adjacent  ridges. Most automatic fingerprint recognition systems are based  on local ridge features known as minutiae. There are about 150  different types of minutiae categorized according to their  configuration. Among these minutia types “ridge ending” and  “ridge bifurcation” are the most commonly used, since the other  types of minutiae can be seen as combinations of “ridge endings”  and “ridge bifurcations”.

The above system is based on the extraction of minutiae from  input images of fingerprints, and then comparison of the  descriptors that define the minutiae.

But for obtaining clearly defined minutiae to mark as keypoints  and extract descriptors from, the images first need to be  processed.
